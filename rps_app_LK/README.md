# Rock Paper Scissors

Work with your partner to create a game of 'Rock Paper Scissors' that runs until one player has three wins

Store the player names and number of wins for each player in variables
Use a while loop to run the game until one player has 3 wins
Use:

var weapons = ['rock' , 'paper', 'scissors'];

var weaponOfChoice = weapons[parseInt(Math.random()*weapons.length) %3];
to randomly select an item

Output each players hand to the console

Use an if or switch statement to determine a winner of the round

Output the round winner's name to the console

Create a way to track how many rounds each player has won

When one player wins 3 rounds, announce that player's name as the game winner
